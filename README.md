# Local Development

1. Clone down the repo

```command
$ git clone git@github.com:netlify/cli.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```command
$ npm install
```

3. Run CLI locally during development

```command
$ ./bin/run [command]
```

When developing, you can use watch mode which will automatically rebuild the cli and run tests with ava:

```command
$ npm run watch
```
